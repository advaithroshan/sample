            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong> Mosquito </strong>
                <p>The mosquito is both the smallest and deadliest animal on this countdown. It kills more people than all the other animals on this list combined. Mosquitoes carry diseases that kill more than 1 million people each year. These diseases include Malaria, Dengue Fever, and Yellow Fever. Malaria alone kills more than 3,000 African children each day.</p>

                <li> 
                    <strong> Puff Adder </strong>
                <p> The puff adder is possibly one of Africa’s most deadly snakes. This snake kills the most people in Africa each year. It is a well camouflaged snake that freezes when someone approaches it. Because it holds so still and is so well camouflaged, people don’t see it lying there. Most bites occur when a person accidentally steps on the snake. While it’s not known exactly how many people the puff adder kills each year, more than 30,000 people die from snakebites in Africa each year.</p>

                    <strong> Black Mamba </strong>
                    <p>The black mamba isn’t actually black. Its narrow body is a light grayish-brown. The inside of its mouth, however, is as black as coal. The black mamba is one of the most venomous snakes in the world. The amount of venom in one bite is enough to kill 12 full-grown men in an hour. The snake is also known to chase people. It can go 12 miles per hour. Growing up to 8 feet long, the black mamba is one of the most feared snakes in Africa.</p>

                    <strong> Tsetse Fly </strong>
                    <p>The tsetse fly is a bloodsucker. It doesn’t look much different from a common housefly. Yet it is responsible for around 10,000 human deaths each year. The tsetse fly carries a parasite that causes Sleeping Sickness. It carries another similar type of parasite that kills livestock like cattle. If the Sleeping Sickness isn’t treated, it causes death.</p>

                    <strong> Nile Crocodile </strong>
                    <p>The Nile crocodile grows to be 16 feet long. It weighs around 500 pounds. Humans share the same water sources as the crocs. That means that crocs and humans run into each other regularly. The Nile croc hides in the water with only its eyes or nose exposed. They are nearly impossible to see. Most croc attacks occur when people go to the water to wash clothes, fish, or bathe. Nile crocs kill at least 3,000 people per year in Africa.</p>
